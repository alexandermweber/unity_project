# About this project
This is my part of a group project.
It is supposed to be a part dungeon crawler part management sim where the player explores dungeons collecting resources to bring back to their tavern.
My job in this group was to make the management sim, so that is all that is here now.
I would like to one day create the rest of the project myself so I can put a full game here, or I might make a new game.

# How to play
Select furniture or walls to buy by colliding your character with it.  The cubes on the floor are where furniture can be purchased.
When you have selected something press the esc key to bring up the pause menu.
There you will be given the option to buy furniture, or select a material to replace the current wall with.
This drains your gold resource, but the more you upgrade the tavern the more customers will appear.
Customers will drain your food and drink resources while adding to your gold resource.
